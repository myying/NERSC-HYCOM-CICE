This directory contains routine for generating ice drift from

a) A series daily files in HYCOM_CICE with name format: iceh.????-??-??.nc

b) Also to support the ensemble files like the names as iceh.????-??-??_ens.nc

c) A daily ice drift from OSISAF: https://osi-saf.eumetsat.int/products/osi-455 (if extending to 2 days then to modify the parameter:NDAYS_OSISAF_DRIFT)

d) There are two kinds of outputs: i) for single file: Mod_drift000.nc and Obs_drift.txt, the latter includes the observation for debugging. ii) for ensemble file: Only binary file used by further DA process.


icedrift_osisafNC: When called with no arguments it shows how to add the arguments.  It contains two ways to run:
        Case 1: (validation one model run)
        icedrift_osisafNC iceh.2019-01-01.nc /cluster/projects/nn2993k/TP4b0.12/idrft_osisaf/  <1/2>
        It automatically searches the observation from the predefined directory, and requires more one day drift from the previous date at the current diretory.            

        Case 2: (validation ensemble model runs)
        icedriftnc_osisaf iceh.2019-01-01.nc /cluster/projects/nn2993k/TP4b0.12/idrft_osisaf/ <1/2> <ens-size>
        It also requires the relevant model files avaiable at the current direcdtory using the name format as the b) mentioned. Its output is named by .uf like iceh.2019-01-01_ens.uf

valid_icedrift.sh: Wrapper around icedrift_osisafNC to calcuulate icedrift for one a snapshot from a model run. And use a python routine of Firstview_icespeed.py ploting the all drift fields and their scatter plots.

NB: Drift is calculated using a Runge-kutta 2nd order approach

Updating history:
i) To support two type of OSISAF products 1-day and 2-days in 22 June 2023 with the option of <1/2>
ii) Correct the small bug using the model daily files to match with the corresponding observation at June 2023 by J. Xie at NERSC.
